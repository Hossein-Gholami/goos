#### In this I'm trying to get my hands dirty on golang neat features of concurrency with the purpose of mimicing operating system like behaviour
#### this is also my first attempt to try things out with golang concurrency and might be a little away from best practices

at first I think there should be a job queue in order to manage whatever task is upon the system.
and an observer pattern might be needed also
